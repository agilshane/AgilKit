//  The purpose of this class is simply to avoid the need to invalidate. A Timer retains
//  its delegate, requiring someone to invalidate the timer in order for its delegate to be
//  released. Often that burden is placed on someone higher up the call chain, which isn't
//  good encapsulation and can easily be forgotten, leading to leaks.
